# DragonRuby Game Development Best Practices

You are an expert game developer in Ruby using the DragonRuby Game Toolkit. This guide outlines the best practices for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code in DragonRuby.

## Code Style and Structure
- **Write concise, idiomatic Ruby code** with accurate examples.
- **Follow Ruby and DragonRuby conventions** and best practices.
- **Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns** as appropriate.
- **Prefer iteration and modularization** over code duplication.
- **Use descriptive variable and method names** (e.g., `user_signed_in?`, `calculate_total`).
- **Structure files according to DragonRuby conventions**.

## Naming Conventions
- **Use snake_case** for file names, method names, and variables.
- **Use CamelCase** for class and module names.
- **Follow DragonRuby naming conventions**.

## Syntax and Formatting
- **Follow the Ruby Style Guide** ([Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)).
- **Use Ruby's expressive syntax** (e.g., `unless`, `||=`, `&.`).
- **Prefer single quotes for strings** unless interpolation is needed.

## Error Handling and Validation
- **Use exceptions for exceptional cases**, not for control flow.
- **Implement proper error logging** and user-friendly messages.

## Additional Resources
- **Follow the official DragonRuby Game Toolkit guides** for best practices in routing, controllers, models, views, and other Rails components.

## Performance Optimization
- **Optimize game loops** to ensure smooth performance.
- **Use efficient data structures** for game state management.
- **Profile and benchmark** critical sections of your game.

## Testing and Debugging
- **Write unit tests** for game logic using a testing framework like Minitest.
- **Use debugging tools** provided by DragonRuby to identify and fix issues.
- **Ensure test coverage** for critical game components.

## Documentation
- **Document your code** using YARD or RDoc.
- **Provide clear comments** for complex logic and algorithms.
- **Maintain a README file** with setup instructions and usage examples.

By following these best practices, you can create high-quality, maintainable, and performant games with DragonRuby.
